Lambda Expressions − a new language feature allowing treating actions as objects
Method References − enable defining Lambda Expressions by referring to methods directly using their names
Optional − special wrapper class used for expressing optionality
Functional Interface – an interface with maximum one abstract method, implementation can be provided using a Lambda Expression
Default methods − give us the ability to add full implementations in interfaces besides abstract methods
